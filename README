INTRODUCTION

This is a Nu version of the code from Doug Hoyte's excellent book 
"Let Over Lambda".  The book is focused on harnessing the power of 
Lisp macros.  If you want to hone your macro-fu, this is a great
book to read.  The book uses and builds on many of the ideas in
Paul Graham's book "On Lisp", so it would be helpful to be familiar
with "On Lisp" first.

I didn't try to port any of the Common Lisp reader macros, as Nu
doesn't currently have a reader macro facility.

Also, I didn't use Hoyte's defmacro! enhancement.  defmacro! adds two
main features to Common Lisp's defmacro:
1. Ability to use gensyms without first declaring them.
2. Ability to declaratively enforce once-only evaluation of macro
   parameters. 

Nu's macro facility already has feature 1.  And feature 2 is 
only a slight amount of syntactic sugar over a let form.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

This code requires Nu 0.4 or above.


AUTHOR

Doug Hoyte wrote the original Common Lisp code to accompany the book.
The code is available at the book's web site.

Jeff Buck ported the code to Nu, added some Common Lisp support functions
that are not already in Nu, and added some enhancements to the utilities.
